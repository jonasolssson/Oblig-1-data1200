        Before starting out programming the website, we sat down and discussed how we wanted the layout to appear.
        After playing around with ideas we ended up with a sketch containing different semantic elements that we wanted
        to implement in our page.

        the first and most obvious semantic tag to apply was the "nav". this contains the part of the website used to navigate around
        the different pages. 

        At the bottom of the page we have a footer, the footer remains constant on all pages and contains link to social medias.

        it also made sense to use the main-tag for the main contents of the page, the same goes for using the header-tag on the header.

        the quote-tag was used to let browser and screen-readers know that oskarÂ´s famous quote is an actual quote.

        we used the article tag to separate the different parts in our portfolio page to make it easier to navigate when coding.
