        <h2>Mona Lisa 2.0</h2>
        <p>One of my many talents is arts and crafts. My most recent project has gone viral online, the Mona Lisa 2.0. The precise use of color, brush strokes and critical thinking has taken the world by storm. Many critics have said that this is even better than the original Mona Lisa.
            Throughout my journey as an artist, I have become more creative, reflected and have learned to think outside of the box.
